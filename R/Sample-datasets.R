#' Sample cell characteristics
#'
#' @description
#'This dataset provides an example of the type of cell characteristics that you
#'should be recording for your data. The dataset contains columns for the animal
#'number, age, sex, the synapses being recorded from, and treatments applied.
#'There is also a column for access, which is stored as a list.
#'
#'The most important column is \code{letter}. This is a unique identifier that
#'you will assign to each recording. The \code{letter} column will enable you to
#'link all information relevant to the recording (evoked current data,
#'spontaneous current data, animal data like age, sex, etc.) from different
#'files.
#'
#'You should import this .csv file using the import_cell_characteristics_df()]
#'function, which will format it in a format that makes it easy to merge with
#'raw recording data in functions like [make_normalized_EPSC_data()]. This will
#'enable you to analyze relationships between properties like age and current
#'amplitude.
