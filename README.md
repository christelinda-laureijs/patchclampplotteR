# patchclampplotteR: Plot and analyze patch clamp data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of patchclampplotteR is to create a set of user-friendly tools
for electrophysiologists who want to plot and analyze data from
whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology recordings. Hereâ€™s some of the
functions that this package can do:

- Plot raw evoked or spontaneous current amplitudes over time for all
  recordings at once.
- Normalize current amplitudes relative to mean baseline values.
- Plot normalized current amplitudes over time for all recordings.
- Plot summary data for a specific treatment, grouped by sex.
- Plot representative spontaneous current traces from an .abf file with
  a scale bar.
- Compare spontaneous current amplitude and frequency
- Compare variance parameters to help determine presynaptic mechanisms.
- And more!

## Installation

You can install the development version of patchclampplotteR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("christelinda-laureijs/patchclampplotteR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
#library(patchclampplotteR)
## basic example code
```
