<p>Before using <code>patchclampplotteR</code>, you will need to prepare
your raw recording data from Clampfit. This article will show you how to
move your evoked post-synaptic current data from raw .abf recordings to
a .csv file.</p>
<p>This recording uses a protocol with two stimuli resulting in two
evoked currents per sweep. The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) is the ratio of
the second evoked current amplitude to the first.</p>

<p><em>Note</em> The data from our lab is not a continuous 30-minute
recording. We pause the recording every 5 minutes to obtain parameters
like access resistance and capacitance from the membrane test before
resuming recording. If your data is already a continuous file, you can
skip steps 1-2.</p>

<li><p>Open the first .abf file in your recording series, and use the
<code>Next File</code> button to quickly open all files in the
series.</p></li>

<code>Letter</code> The unique letter identifier of a single

<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em> I would strongly recommend using the filename of the
first file in the series (but write down the concatenated filename in
your lab book as well). This is because Clampfit will auto-generate the
concatenated file names (<code>Concatenate001.abf</code>,
<code>Concatenate002.abf</code>, etc.). If you update your pClamp
software, Clampfit will begin naming files again at
<code>Concatenate000.abf</code>, and you could lose track of which file
is which.</p>

include all sweeps, the trace selection should show
<code>t1..360</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Warning!</strong> Check that all the settings are correct,
especially if you have done other analyses in Clampfit recently. For
example, the polarity may be set to <code>Positive-going</code>, and you

<li><p>Create a new .csv file. This will eventually become a large
spreadsheet with information on all recordings in your entire dataset.
As you add new recordings, update this cell characteristics sheet.
Please see the <strong>Required columns</strong> section of the
documentation for <code><a href="../reference/import_cell_characteristics_df.html">import_cell_characteristics_df()</a></code> for
explanations of the required columns and what they include.</p></li>
<li><p>After you have completed these steps for several recordings, you
should have two .csv files:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A .csv file with the evoked current amplitudes (<code>P1</code> and
<code>P2</code>)</li>
<li>A .csv file containing information on the cell characteristics</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have these two files, you are ready to begin using
<code>patchclampplotteR</code>! See the <a href="https://christelinda-laureijs.github.io/patchclampplotteR/articles/patchclampplotteR.html">Getting

<p><em>There are some noisy traces or traces with strange
artifacts.</em></p>
<p>You can exclude individual traces (for example ones with lots of
noise or a very unstable baseline) in the Trace Selection box of Step
11. Select the traces you want to exclude, then <code>Invert</code> your
selection.</p>

<p><em>What does it mean when there are two currents close
together?</em></p>
<p><img src="figures/Multivesicular-release.png" alt="A screenshot of a recording with two currents after a stimulation. This is an example of multivesicular release." width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>If you see two peaks instead of one expected evoked current, this
could be an example of multivesicular release. Make a note of this,
since the treatment could lead to changes in synaptic activity through
this interesting mechanism.</p>
<p><em>I have some new recordings. Do I add them to my existing .csv
files, or make new files?</em></p>
<p>You should save a new .csv file for each new batch of raw data (these
are the .csv files with <code>Letter</code>, <code>ID</code>,
<code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code>). You may find it efficient to wait
until you have a week of recordings, then analyze these recordings all
at once in Clampfit. These data will be in a .csv file named something
like <code>20240708-eEPSC-data.csv</code>.</p>
<p>However, when writing a paper or thesis, you will use just one master
csv file which contains the evoked current data for all recordings in
the entire project. To append new data to this master csv, use the
<code><a href="../reference/add_new_cells.html">add_new_cells()</a></code> function. Please see
<code><a href="../articles/patchclampplotteR.html">vignette("patchclampplotteR")</a></code> for more details.</p>
<p><em>I am seeing twice as many data columns than I expected
(e.g. <code>R1S1</code>, <code>R1S2</code>, <code>R2S1</code> and
<code>R2S2</code>)</em></p>
<p>The <code>R</code> stands for <code>Region</code> and the
<code>S</code> stands for <code>Signal</code>. If you see more than one
<code>S</code> (for example, <code>R1S1</code> and <code>R1S2</code>)
this indicates that you have selected both signals (Im_primary AND
Vm_primary). In the <code>Statistics</code> dialog box
(<code>Alt + s</code>) click on <code>Trace Selection</code> and ensure
that only one signal is selected. Sometimes this is accidentally
switched to <code>All visible signals</code> which is incorrect.</p>
<p>If you see multiple <code>R</code> columns, it may indicate that you
have extra search regions enabled. If you only want one search region,
double-check that Search Region 2 isn’t accidentally checked. Click the
up arrow next to the number box and ensure that the box next to Search
Region 2 is unchecked.</p>
<p><em>I want to analyze both evoked currents at the same time, but I am
only seeing one data column (<code>R1S1</code>).</em> This is the
opposite of the issue above. This time, you do not have enough Search
Regions enabled. In the <code>Statistics</code> dialog box
(<code>Alt + s</code>) click the up arrow next to the number box and
ensure that Search Region 2 is enabled.</p>
