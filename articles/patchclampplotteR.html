<p>To use this package, set up a new folder on your computer. Give the
folder a short, distinctive name with no spaces (use hyphens instead). I
would strongly recommend adding subfolders with names like
<code>Data</code>, <code>Figures</code>, and <code>Thesis</code>. This
will help with organization and make it easier to expand to future
projects, like writing your thesis in R.</p>

A screenshot of the file structure of a typical project. There are
folders for data, figures, scripts and the thesis. Files with a ‘.’ in
the name are automatically generated when you set up your project. If
you aren’t using git to track your files, don’t worry about the
filenames that start with ‘git’
</p>
</div>
<p>In RStudio, click on <code>File</code> -&gt; <code>New project</code>
-&gt; <code>Existing Directory</code> and choose the folder you just
created. Click on <code>Create Project</code> and R will refresh to a
blank, new project. You’re now ready to create a new R Markdown (.Rmd)
file and start your analysis!</p>

<p>This sample dataset consists of whole-cell patch clamp recordings of
neurons within the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), a brain region
critical for appetite regulation, stress responses and other processes.
I recorded evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents for five minutes
under baseline conditions, then added 500 nM insulin to the perfusion
solution, and I continued recording for 25 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My goal is to determine if insulin affects evoked current amplitude
in DMH neurons.</p>

<p>First, I must import a <code>.csv</code> file containing information
about factors such as the animal’s age and sex, the cell ID number, and
other details. Please see the <strong>Required columns</strong> section
of the documentation for <code><a href="../reference/import_cell_characteristics_df.html">import_cell_characteristics_df()</a></code>
for full explanations of the required columns and what you should
include.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Since this vignette is included within an R package, the
following code requires the function <code><a href="../reference/import_ext_data.html">import_ext_data()</a></code> to
properly locate the <code>.csv</code> file in the package folder. This
won’t be required when you are using the package within your own project
folder.</p>
<p>Do NOT include <code><a href="../reference/import_ext_data.html">import_ext_data()</a></code> in your code, because
it won’t work. You can just write the path to the filename directly
within <code><a href="../reference/import_cell_characteristics_df.html">import_cell_characteristics_df()</a></code>. For example, you
should write
<code>import_cell_characteristics_df("Data/cell_info.csv")</code> to use
<code>cell_info.csv</code> located within the <code>Data/</code>
folder.</p>

<p>Next, I will import the raw evoked current data that has been copied
over from Clampfit (again, please see the <a href="https://christelinda-laureijs.github.io/patchclampplotteR/articles/evoked-current-analysis.html">Evoked
Current Analysis vignette</a> for details about how to analyze this data
in Clampfit. This is a <code>.csv</code> file containing four columns:
<code>letter</code>, <code>ID</code>, <code>P1</code> and
<code>P2</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>letter</code>: A unique identifier for a single recording,
which allows you to link evoked current data, spontaneous current data,
action potential, data, and information on cell
characteristics.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ID</code>: The name of the .abf filename used to obtain the
data, which is useful for verifying the recordings and cross-referencing
to your lab book.</p></li>
<li><p><code>P1</code>: The amplitude of the first evoked current
(pA).</p></li>
<li><p><code>P2</code>: The amplitude of the second evoked current
(pA).</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Try to match the capitalization of the column names to the examples
listed here. If you do forget to make them lowercase, don’t worry.
<code><a href="../reference/add_new_cells.html">add_new_cells()</a></code> will automatically convert all column names
to lowercase for consistency across functions. Capitalized letters will
be retained for columns like <code>ID</code>, <code>X</code>,
<code>Y</code>, <code>P1</code>, and <code>P2</code>.</p>

<p>The next step is to merge the raw evoked current data with the cell
characteristics data. <code><a href="../reference/add_new_cells.html">add_new_cells()</a></code> will merge these two
datasets, using <code>letter</code> as the common column. This function
requires three <code>.csv</code> files:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new raw data</li>
<li>The cell characteristics</li>
<li>An existing <code>.csv</code> with raw data that has been previously
imported. As your project goes on, you will eventually be appending new
data onto your existing datasheet, but if you are starting completely
fresh, use a blank <code>.csv</code> file containing just the required
column names.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING!!</strong> If you are starting with a blank
<code>.csv</code> file containing only the column names, you MUST type a
character value in the letter column (typically, cell A2 if you are
using Excel). This is so that R will recognize the letter column as a

<p><code><a href="../reference/add_new_cells.html">add_new_cells()</a></code> produces several warnings and messages.
One warning lets you know you know that the column names have been
renamed to lowercase. This is to avoid case-sensitive issues from
appearing in later functions.</p>
<p>The first message generated with <code><a href="../reference/add_new_cells.html">add_new_cells()</a></code>
indicate that the <code>sample_cell_characteristics.csv</code> and
<code>sample_new_eEPSC_data.csv</code> have the same cells. This is
useful to catch if you forget to add the cell characteristics for the
new data.</p>
<p>The second message indicates that all letters in the new data are new
relative to the existing dataset. This ensures that you don’t
accidentally paste in the same data twice, resulting in duplicated
data.</p>
<p>The final message prints a list of the letters that have been added
to the dataset. In this case, this is <code>AV</code>. It is a good way
to confirm that you’ve added the letters you were planning to add.</p>
<p>You can also ask R to produce a list of all of the unique letters in
the dataset. This won’t catch duplicates, but it can help you identify
if a letter is completely missing from the dataset. See, <code>AV</code>
is now included!</p>
<p>However, you can also see that the placeholder “blank” is still
present.</p>

<p>After you have finished a brief exploration of your data, it is time
to analyze it!</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="step-1-normalize-currents">Step 1: Normalize currents<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#step-1-normalize-currents"></a>
</h4>
<p>The first step is to normalize the current amplitudes within each
recording relative to the average current amplitude during the baseline
period. This makes it easier to compare across cells that have a wide
range of starting amplitudes, since all baseline values will be
converted to (roughly) 100%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note how I set the minimum and maximum time values. This will limit
the data to values between 0 min and 25 minutes.</p>
<p>I set the <code>interval_length</code> to 5 because I wanted to
divide my data into 5-minute intervals for later statistical
analyses.</p>
<p>The baseline period (<code>baseline_length</code>) lasted 5 minutes.
Clampfit recorded the current amplitude as negative values, so I set
<code>negative_transform_currents</code> to “yes” which will flip the
current amplitudes to positive values.</p>

<p><code><a href="../reference/make_normalized_EPSC_data.html">make_normalized_EPSC_data()</a></code> will retain the cell
characteristics and <code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code> values from
before. However, you will notice some changes.</p>
<p>If you set <code>negative_transform</code> to “yes”, <code>P1</code>
and <code>P2</code> will be multiplied by <code>-1</code>. This is to
“flip” current amplitude data that was recorded as negative values in
Clampfit. Since the data are evoked current data
(<code>current_type = "eEPSC"</code>), some new columns are added. They
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>PPR</code>: The paired-pulse ratio, which is the amplitude
of the second evoked current divided by the first evoked current
(<code>PPR = P2/P1</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>interval</code>: The interval that the data belongs to. I
set the <code>interval_length</code> to 5, which means the data will be
divided into 5-minute intervals. The intervals will have names like
“t0to5”, “t5to10”, and so on up until the maximum interval.</p></li>
<li><p><code>baseline_range</code>: You probably won’t interact with
this much, but this is just a column stating “TRUE” if the time is
within the baseline period, or “FALSE” if the time is outside of this
range. This is required for the normalization function to identify which
values are outside of the baseline (and should be transformed).</p></li>
<li><p><code>baseline_mean</code>: This is one number that represents
the average evoked current amplitude during the baseline period. This
value is different for each recording.</p></li>
<li><p><code>P1_transformed</code>: The first evoked current amplitude,
normalized relative to the mean baseline amplitude. For example, if the
mean baseline amplitude is <strong>80 pA</strong> and a <code>P1</code>
value is <strong>40 pA</strong>, <code>P1_transformed</code> will be
<strong>50%</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>P2_transformed</code>: The second evoked current amplitude,
normalized relative to the mean baseline amplitude of the first evoked
current.</p></li>

<p>We can use variance measures like the coefficient of variation and
the variance-to-mean ratio (VMR) to help determine if a mechanism is
presynaptic or post-synaptic (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.108526" class="external-link">van Huijstee &amp;
Kessels, 2020</a> for more details). This package contains functions
such as <code><a href="../reference/make_variance_data.html">make_variance_data()</a></code> and
<code><a href="../reference/plot_variance_comparison_data.html">plot_variance_comparison_data()</a></code> to allow you to perform
variance analysis quickly from summary evoked current data (e.g. data

period. If <code>current_type</code> = “eEPSC”, the allowed

<p>Hopefully this vignette has given you an idea of some of the plotting
functions that this package can do. The documentation for each function
contains lots of additional information about each argument, and you can
also explore the articles for <a href="https://christelinda-laureijs.github.io/patchclampplotteR/articles/evoked-current-analysis.html">Evoked
Current Analysis</a> and <a href="https://christelinda-laureijs.github.io/patchclampplotteR/articles/action-potential-analysis.html">Action
Potential Analysis</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about customizing your plots, read the <a href="https://christelinda-laureijs.github.io/patchclampplotteR/articles/FAQ.html">FAQ</a>
page. There will likely be an answer there!</p>
