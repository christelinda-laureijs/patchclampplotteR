<p><code>patchclampplotteR</code> is an exciting new package that will
help you analyze and plot your patch clamp data efficiently. This
vignette will walk you through the complete process of transforming raw
data into publication-quality plots!</p>

<h3 id="set-up-r-project">Set up R Project<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#set-up-r-project"></a>
</h3>
<p>To use this package, set up a new folder on your computer. Give the
folder a short, distinctive name with no spaces (use hyphens instead). I
would strongly recommend adding subfolders with names like
<code>Data</code>, <code>Figures</code>, and <code>Thesis</code>. This
will help with organization and make it easier to expand to future
projects, like writing your thesis in R.</p>

A screenshot of the file structure of a typical project. There are
folders for data, figures, scripts and the thesis. Files with a ‘.’ in
the name, like .gitignore or .Rhistory, are automatically generated when
you set up your project. If you aren’t using git to track your files,
don’t worry about the filenames that start with ‘git’
</p>
</div>
<p>In RStudio, click on <code>File</code> -&gt; <code>New project</code>
-&gt; <code>Existing Directory</code> and choose the folder you just
created. Click on <code>Create Project</code> and R will refresh to a
blank, new project. You’re now ready to create a new R Markdown (.Rmd)
file and start your analysis!</p>

<p>This sample dataset consists of whole-cell patch clamp recordings of
neurons within the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), a brain region
critical for appetite regulation, stress responses and other processes.
I recorded evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents for five minutes
under baseline conditions, then added 500 nM insulin to the perfusion
solution, and I continued recording for 25 minutes.</p>

<p>My goal is to determine if insulin affects evoked current amplitude
in DMH neurons.</p>

<p>First, I must import a <code>.csv</code> file containing information
about factors such as the animal’s age and sex, the cell ID number, and
other details. Please see the <strong>Required columns</strong> section
below for full explanations of the required columns and what you should
include. There is also a link to download an empty <code>.csv</code>
file with the headers required for this dataset:</p>

<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="required-columns">Required columns<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#required-columns"></a>
</h5>
<p>The columns listed below are required in the raw .csv file. If you do
not have data for any of these columns, please still include the column
as an “empty” column to prevent errors caused by missing columns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t worry about missing data! R will automatically fill blank cells
with ‘NA’ values, which will be ignored in the analyses.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<code>letter</code> A character value that is a unique identifier
for a single recording. You can use this link recordings that came from
the same cell. For example, from cell “A” you may have action potential
recordings, evoked current data, and spontaneous current data.</li>
<li>
<code>cell</code> A character or numeric value representing the
cell. For example, use <code>3.1.1</code> for animal #3, slice #1, cell
#1.</li>
<li>
<code>sex</code> A character value such as “Male” or “Female”.</li>
<li>
<code>X</code> A numeric value representing the x-value of the
cell’s location in µm. (Leave blank if you don’t have this).</li>
<li>
<code>Y</code> A numeric value representing the y-value of the
cell’s location in µm. (Leave blank if you don’t have this).</li>
<li>
<code>age</code> A numeric value representing the animal’s age. Can
be any value as long as the time units are consistent throughout
(e.g. don’t mix up days and months when reporting animal ages). Do not
use characters (e.g. Do NOT write <code>P31</code>. Use <code>31</code>
instead).</li>
<li>
<code>animal</code> A numeric value representing the animal’s ID
number.</li>
<li>
<code>synapses</code> A character value such as “Glutamate” or
“GABA”.</li>
<li>
<code>treatment</code> A character value such as “Control” or
“HNMPA”.</li>
<li>
<code>category</code> A numeric value representing an experiment
type. For example, ‘1’ may mean 4 seconds of high-frequency stimulation
(HFS), ‘2’ may mean an experiment where you added insulin, and ‘3’ may
mean HFS with insulin in the bath at all times. A category is the
top-level division of your data. You can then have subgroups using the
<code>treatment</code> variable. For example, perhaps you added insulin
(Category <code>2</code>) and also had the antagonist HNMPA present.
This would be <code>Category = 2, Treatment = HNMPA</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Treatment-schematic.jpg" alt="A diagram showing two rows of data. The first has the text Category = 2 (add insulin), while the second row has Treatment, followed by the words Control, HNMPA, PPP and HNMPA and PPP combined. The goal of this figure is to show that treatments are nested under category." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>R_a</code> A list of values for the access resistance, which
would have been monitored at several timepoints throughout the
recording. See the section <code>R_a</code> formatting below.</li>
<li>
<code>days_alone</code> A numeric value representing the number of
days that the animal was alone in a cage. This will always be 1 for some
treatments, like fasting, but should ideally be low to reduce the
effects of social isolation-related stress.</li>
<li>
<code>animal_or_slicing_problems</code> A character value (“yes” or
“no”) indicating if there were any problems during any point of the
slice preparation process or animal handling. For example, use “yes” if
the slices were crumpling during slicing or the animal was unusually
anxious.)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Since you are using an R Project, it is easy to identify files
in sub-folders. For example, you can write
<code>import_cell_characteristics_df("Data/cell_info.csv")</code> to use
<code>cell_info.csv</code> located within the <code>Data/</code>
subfolder.</p>

Current Analysis vignette</a> for details about how to analyze this data

<code>letter</code>, <code>ID</code>, <code>P1</code> and

<ul>
<li><p><code>letter</code>: A unique identifier for a single recording,
which allows you to link evoked current data, spontaneous current data,
action potential, data, and information on cell

<li><p><code>ID</code>: The name of the .abf filename used to obtain the

<p>Try to match the capitalization of the column names to the examples
listed here. If you do forget to make them lowercase, don’t worry.
<code><a href="../reference/add_new_cells.html">add_new_cells()</a></code> will automatically convert all column names

<p>The next step is to merge the raw evoked current data with the cell
characteristics data. <code><a href="../reference/add_new_cells.html">add_new_cells()</a></code> will merge these two
datasets, using <code>letter</code> as the common column. This function
requires three <code>.csv</code> files:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new raw data</li>
<li>The cell characteristics</li>
<li>An existing <code>.csv</code> with raw data that has been previously
imported. As your project goes on, you will eventually be appending new
data onto your existing datasheet, but if you are starting completely
fresh, use a blank <code>.csv</code> file containing just one value in
cell <code>A1</code> called <code>letter</code>. This column title is
all that is needed to allow R to auto-fill in the rest of the new
data.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING!!</strong> If you are starting from an empty
<code>.csv</code> file, the <code>.csv</code> in the

<p><code><a href="../reference/add_new_cells.html">add_new_cells()</a></code> produces several warnings and messages.
One warning lets you know you know that the column names have been
renamed to lowercase. This is to avoid case-sensitive issues from
appearing in later functions.</p>
<p>The first message generated with <code><a href="../reference/add_new_cells.html">add_new_cells()</a></code>
indicate that the <code>sample_cell_characteristics.csv</code> and
<code>sample_new_eEPSC_data.csv</code> have the same cells. This is
useful to catch if you forget to add the cell characteristics for the
new data.</p>
<p>The second message indicates that all letters in the new data are new
relative to the existing dataset. This ensures that you don’t
accidentally paste in the same data twice, resulting in duplicated
data.</p>
<p>The final message prints a list of the letters that have been added
to the dataset. In this case, these are “FX”, “GR” and “HC”. It is a
good way to confirm that you’ve added the letters you were planning to
add.</p>
<p>You can also ask R to produce a list of all of the unique letters in
the dataset. This won’t catch duplicates, but it can help you identify
if a letter is completely missing from the dataset. See, <code>FX</code>
is now included!</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="step-1-normalize-currents">Step 1: Normalize currents<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#step-1-normalize-currents"></a>
</h4>
<p>The first step is to normalize the current amplitudes within each
recording relative to the average current amplitude during the baseline
period. This makes it easier to compare across cells that have a wide
range of starting amplitudes, since all baseline values will be
converted to (roughly) 100%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note how I set the minimum and maximum time values. This will limit
the data to values between 0 min and 25 minutes.</p>
<p>I set the <code>interval_length</code> to 5 because I wanted to
divide my data into 5-minute intervals for later statistical
analyses.</p>
<p>The baseline period (<code>baseline_length</code>) lasted 5 minutes.
Clampfit recorded the current amplitude as negative values, so I set
<code>negative_transform_currents</code> to “yes” which will flip the
current amplitudes to positive values.</p>

<p>If you set <code>negative_transform</code> to “yes”, <code>P1</code>
and <code>P2</code> will be multiplied by <code>-1</code>. This is to
“flip” current amplitude data that was recorded as negative values in
Clampfit. Since the data are evoked current data
(<code>current_type = "eEPSC"</code>), some new columns are added. They
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>PPR</code>: The paired-pulse ratio, which is the amplitude
of the second evoked current divided by the first evoked current
(<code>PPR = P2/P1</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>interval</code>: The interval that the data belongs to. I
set the <code>interval_length</code> to 5, which means the data will be
divided into 5-minute intervals. The intervals will have names like
“t0to5”, “t5to10”, and so on up until the maximum interval.</p></li>
<li><p><code>baseline_range</code>: You probably won’t interact with
this much, but this is just a column stating “TRUE” if the time is
within the baseline period, or “FALSE” if the time is outside of this
range. This is required for the normalization function to identify which
values are outside of the baseline (and should be transformed).</p></li>
<li><p><code>baseline_mean</code>: This is one number that represents
the average evoked current amplitude during the baseline period. This
value is different for each recording.</p></li>
<li><p><code>P1_transformed</code>: The first evoked current amplitude,
normalized relative to the mean baseline amplitude. For example, if the
mean baseline amplitude is <strong>80 pA</strong> and a <code>P1</code>
value is <strong>40 pA</strong>, <code>P1_transformed</code> will be
<strong>50%</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>P2_transformed</code>: The second evoked current amplitude,
normalized relative to the mean baseline amplitude of the first evoked
current.</p></li>

<p>You now have your data in an easy-to-manipulate format, and you have
the freedom to choose what analysis you want to do next! For example,
you could look at the paired-pulse ratio, changes in variance
parameters, or compare baseline values. See below for examples of how to
use these functions.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="looking-at-cell-characteristics">Looking at cell characteristics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#looking-at-cell-characteristics"></a>
</h4>
<p>You can use your summary data (particularly the
<code>$percent_change_data</code>) to make some interesting plots. Using
<code>cell_characteristics</code> data throughout makes it very easy to
answer interesting questions about your data. For example, does the
baseline evoked current amplitude (data from <code>t0to5</code>) affect
a cell’s insulin sensitivity? I can use <code>percent_change</code> as a
marker of the effect size of insulin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The sample dataset included in this package is too small to
show anything meaningful, so I’m including static images from my dataset
(manuscript in preparation).</p>

<p>Does an animal’s age affect the cell’s sensitivity to insulin? In the
following plot, I also coloured the points by the baseline evoked
current amplitude to see if this would show any new patterns.</p>

<p>The plotting functions provided in <code>patchclampplotteR</code> are
actually just shortcuts to make plots with ggplot. All the data that you
need is provided with functions like
<code><a href="../reference/make_summary_EPSC_data.html">make_summary_EPSC_data()</a></code>, <code><a href="../reference/make_variance_data.html">make_variance_data()</a></code>
and <code><a href="../reference/make_PPR_data.html">make_PPR_data()</a></code>. Why don’t you try making your own
plots in ggplot?</p>
<p>As an example, here is the same <code>$percent_change_data</code>
from <code><a href="../reference/make_summary_EPSC_data.html">make_summary_EPSC_data()</a></code> presented in
<strong>8</strong> different ways!! I haven’t included the code and data
here because this is from my own research, but the list below should
give you a good idea of what functions you could use to create similar
plots.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A)</strong> <em>Grouped categorical scatterplot</em> with
<code>geom_point(position = position_dodge)</code> to separate the
sexes.</li>
<li>
<strong>B)</strong> <em>Sina plot</em>. Uses <code>geom_sina</code>
from the <code>ggforce</code> package.</li>
<li>
<strong>C)</strong> <em>Coloured violin plot with sina
plot</em>.</li>
<li>
<strong>D)</strong> <em>Violin plot with coloured sina
plot</em>.</li>
<li>
<strong>E)</strong> <em>Boxplot + sina plot</em> where
<code>fill = treatment</code>.</li>
<li>
<strong>F)</strong> <em>Boxplot + sina plot</em> where
<code>colour = treatment</code>.</li>
<li>
<strong>G)</strong> <em>Barcode plot </em> (this is just
<code>geom_point(shape = 95, size = 10)</code>, with
<code>alpha = sex</code>)</li>
<li>
<strong>H)</strong> <em>Half-eye plot</em> using
<code>stat_halfeye()</code> from the <code>ggdist()</code> package</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Same-data-8-ways.png" alt="A series of plots showing percent change in evoked current amplitude after 25 minutes of adding insulin.

Figures E and F show boxplots, and Figure G shows a strip plot. Figure H shows a half-eye plot." width="1800" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Hopefully this vignette has given you an idea of some of the plotting
functions that this package can do. The documentation for each function
contains lots of additional information about each argument, and you can
