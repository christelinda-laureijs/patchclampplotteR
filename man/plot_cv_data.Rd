\usage{
plot_cv_data(
  data,
  plot_treatment = "Control",
  plot_category,
  treatment_colour_theme,
  included_sexes = "both",

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe of the pruned current data for all cells. This is the
third dataframe in the list generated from \code{\link[=make_pruned_EPSC_data]{make_pruned_EPSC_data()}}.}

\item{plot_treatment}{A character value specifying the treatment you would
like to plot (e.g. \code{"Control"}). \code{plot_treatment} represents antagonists that
were present on the brain slice, or the animals were fasted, etc.}

\item{plot_category}{A numeric value specifying the category, which can be
used to differentiate different protocol types. In the sample dataset for
this package, \code{plot_category == 2} represents experiments where insulin was
applied continuously after a 5-minute baseline period.}

\item{treatment_colour_theme}{A dataframe containing treatment names and
their associated colours as hex values. See
\link{sample_treatment_names_and_colours} for an example of what this dataframe
should look like.}

\item{included_sexes}{A character value (\code{"both"}, \code{"male"} or \code{"female"}). Useful if you want to have a plot with data from one sex only. Defaults to \code{"both"}. If you choose a single sex, the resulting plot will have \code{"-males-only"} or \code{"-females-only"} in the file name. WARNING!! If you choose \code{"male"} or \code{"female"}, you MUST ensure that the \code{t_test_df} contains data that has been filtered to only include one sex. Otherwise, the significance stars will represent both sexes and it will be inaccurate.}

\item{male_label}{A character value used to describe how males are encoded in the \code{sex} column of the dataframe used in \code{data}. Examples include \code{"Males"}, \code{"Male"}, \code{"male"}, \code{"males"}, \code{"M"}, etc.  This must be consistent in all data sheets. Defaults to \code{"Male"}.}

\item{female_label}{A character value used to describe how females are encoded in the \code{sex} column of the dataframe used in \code{data}. Examples include \code{"Females"}, \code{"Female"}, \code{"female"}, \code{"females"}, \code{"F"}, etc. This must be consistent in all data sheets. Defaults to \code{"Female"}.}

\item{theme_options}{A dataframe containing theme options. See
\link{sample_theme_options} for an example of what this dataframe should
look like.}

\item{save_plot_png}{A character (\code{"yes"} or \code{"no"}). If \code{"yes"}, the plot will be
saved as a .png using ggsave. The filepath depends on the current type, but
they will all go in subfolders below \verb{Figures/} in your project directory.}

\item{ggplot_theme}{The name of a ggplot theme or your custom theme. This will be added as a layer to a ggplot object. The default is \code{patchclampplotteR_theme()}, but other valid entries include \code{theme_bw()}, \code{theme_classic()} or the name of a custom ggplot theme stored as an object.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object. If \code{save_plot_png == "yes"} it will also generate a
.png file in the folder \code{Figures/Evoked-currents/CV} relative to the
project directory. The treatment will be included with the filename.
}
\description{
\code{plot_cv_data()} enables you to save a plot of the coefficient of variation
in evoked current amplitudes over time.

}
\seealso{
\code{\link[=plot_variance_comparison_data]{plot_variance_comparison_data()}} to make plots of inverse
coefficient of variation squared and VMR, which are useful to determine if
a mechanism is pre- or post-synaptic.
