}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A dataframe generated using \code{import_ABF_file()} with \code{recording_mode = "current_clamp"}.}

\item{sweeps}{A character value or list of character values of the sweeps you would like to plot. These correspond to the values in the \code{sweep1} column of your dataset, and will likely be in the form of "epi1", "epi2", etc.}

\item{trace_color}{A hex value of the colour of the lineplot}

\item{line_width}{A numeric value specifying the width of the lineplot}

\item{plot_category}{A numeric value specifying the category, which can be
used to differentiate different protocol types. In the sample dataset for
this package, \code{plot_category == 2} represents experiments where insulin was
applied continuously after a 5-minute baseline period.}

\item{plot_treatment}{A character value specifying the treatment you would
like to plot (e.g. "Control"). \code{plot_treatment} represents antagonists that
were present on the brain slice, or the animals were fasted, etc.}

\item{state}{A character value describing if the recording was taken during the baseline period or post-treatment/protocol. Examples include "Baseline", "Post-insulin". The \code{state} will be included in the .png filename if \code{save_plot_png = "yes"}.}

\item{include_scale_bar}{A character value that determines if a scale bar
will be added to the plot. Allowed values are "yes" and "no".}

\item{scale_bar_x_start}{A numeric value (in milliseconds) describing the x-axis position of
the scale bar (default is 880).}

\item{scale_bar_x_length}{A numeric value describing the horizontal span (in
milliseconds) of the scale bar (default is 100).}

\item{scaling_factor}{A numeric value describing the scaling factor applied by Clampfit to convert recording time to time in milliseconds. The default is 10, and this value will likely not need to be changed.}

\item{scale_bar_y_start}{A numeric value describing the y-axis position (in mV) of
the scale bar (default is -30).}

\item{scale_bar_y_length}{A numeric value describing the vertical span (in
mV) of the scale bar (default is 40).}

\item{scale_bar_linewidth}{A numeric value describing the thickness of the scalebar line (default is 0.6).}

\item{save_plot_png}{A character ("yes" or "no"). If "yes", the plot will be
saved as a .png using ggsave. The filepath depends on the current type, but
they will all go in subfolders below Figures/ in your project directory.}

\item{filename_suffix}{Optional character value to add a suffix to the
filename of the .png file created with this plot. Could be useful if you
have specified a custom list of treatments.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object. If \code{save_plot_png == "yes"}, it will also generate
a .png file in the folder \code{Figures/Action-potentials/Representative-traces} relative to the
project directory.
}
\description{
This function allows you to plot an \code{.abf} file of a recording taken in current clamp mode. It is useful if you want to display a representative trace of action potentials or the results of a current injection protocol.
