style="color:#0093fb;font-weight:bold;">R</span> provides a set of user-friendly
tools for electrophysiologists who want to plot and analyze data from whole-cell
patch clamp electrophysiology recordings. Here's some of the functions that this
package can do (see below for examples!):


```{r header-image, fig.align = 'center', fig.alt = "A banner with pictures of some of the plots that can be created with the patchclampplotteR package.", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-plot-sampler.png")
```

* Plot raw evoked or spontaneous current amplitudes over time for all recordings at once.
* Normalize current amplitudes relative to mean baseline values.
* Plot normalized current amplitudes over time for all recordings.
* Plot summary data for a specific treatment, grouped by sex.
* Plot representative spontaneous current traces from an .abf file with a scale bar.
* Compare spontaneous current amplitude and frequency
* Compare variance parameters to help determine presynaptic mechanisms.
* And more!

```{r load-library-initial, include=FALSE}
library(patchclampplotteR)
```


## Examples

Plot raw evoked currents for a specific cell:

```{r example-raw-eEPSC-plot, fig.alt = "A plot of evoked current amplitude (in pA) over time in minutes showing a decrease in evoked current amplitude after adding insulin."}
raw_eEPSC_control_plots <- plot_raw_current_data(
  data = sample_raw_eEPSC_df,
  plot_treatment = "Control",
  plot_category = 2,
  current_type = "eEPSC",
  y_variable = "P1",
  pruned = "no",
  hormone_added = "Insulin",
  hormone_or_HFS_start_time = 5,
  theme_options = sample_theme_options,
  treatment_colour_theme = sample_treatment_names_and_colours
)

raw_eEPSC_control_plots$AO
```


Plot evoked current amplitudes summarized by sex:  


```{r example-summary-eEPSC-plot, warning=F, fig.alt = "A scatterplot showing evoked current amplitude (% baseline) versus time in minutes, where 500 nM of insulin have been added from 5 minutes and onwards. Insulin significantly decreased current amplitude in both males and females."}
plot_summary_current_data(
  plot_category = 2,
  plot_treatment = "Control",
  data = sample_pruned_eEPSC_df$all_cells,
  current_type = "eEPSC",
  y_variable = "amplitude",
  significance_display_method = "stars",
  include_representative_trace = "no",
  y_axis_limit = 175,
  signif_stars = "yes",
  t_test_df = sample_eEPSC_t_test_df,
  hormone_added = "Insulin",
  large_axis_text = "no",
  shade_intervals = "no",
  hormone_or_HFS_start_time = 5,
  treatment_colour_theme = sample_treatment_names_and_colours,
  theme_options = sample_theme_options
)
```

Plot a representative recording trace showing spontaneous currents from a raw Axon Binary File (.ABF):

```{r example-spontaneous-current-trace-plot, fig.alt = "A representative trace from a raw abf recording, showing a series of noisy, negative-going peaks. Each peak represents a spontaneous current"}
plot_spontaneous_current_trace(
  data = sample_abf_file,
  plot_colour = "#6600cc",
  plot_category = 2,
  plot_treatment = "Control",
  state = "Baseline",
  plot_episode = "epi1",
  trace_annotation = "Baseline",
  geom_text_colour = "#6600cc"
)
```


Plot action potential traces...

```{r ap-trace-viridis, fig.alt = "A plot of current clamp steps where each sweep is coloured a different colour"}
plot_AP_trace(
  data = sample_ap_abf_baseline,
  sweeps = as.character(unique(sample_ap_abf_baseline$episode)),
  colour_scale_option = "viridis",
  plot_category = 2,
  plot_treatment = "Control",
  direction = -1,
  option = "plasma",
  begin = 0,
  end = 0.8
)
```


...and a summary of differences in action potential frequency across treatments.

```{r ap-frequencies-one-treatment, fig.alt = "A plot of Action Potential Frequency in Hz versus current injection on the x-axis. The data are coloured gray for baseline data and purple for insulin data. The plot is showing that action potential frequency was lower after adding insulin."}
plot_AP_frequencies_single_treatment(
  data = sample_AP_count_data,
  plot_treatment = "Control",
  plot_category = 2,
  baseline_label = "Baseline",
  hormone_added = "Insulin",
  treatment_colour_theme = sample_treatment_names_and_colours,
  significance_display_method = "stars",
  large_axis_text = "no",
  test_type = "wilcox.test",
  theme_options = sample_theme_options,
  save_plot_png = "no"
)
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of patchclampplotteR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install-package-demo, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("christelinda-laureijs/patchclampplotteR")
```

And then load the package with `library()`:

```{r load-library, eval=FALSE}
library(patchclampplotteR)
```
